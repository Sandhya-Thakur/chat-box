# chat-boxGTP and Next.js Integration
This repository demonstrates the integration of ChatGTP and Next.js for building real-time chat applications.

First, you will need to sign up for a ChatGTP account and create a new chatbot. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this in the ChatGTP documentation.

Once you have created your chatbot, you will need to obtain the chatbot's API key. This can be found in the ChatGTP dashboard under the "Settings" tab.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

In the root of the repository, create a file named .env and add the following line:CHATGTP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the API key for your chatbot.

Run npm install to install the required dependencies.

Run npm run dev to start the development server.

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the chatbot in action.

How it Works
The Next.js application uses the chatgtp-js library to communicate with the ChatGTP API. The chatbot's API key is stored in a .env file and is accessed via the dotenv package.

The chatbot's response is displayed in the index.js file, which also contains the logic for handling user input. The user can type a message and send it to the chatbot. The chatbot's response is then displayed on the screen.

The integration of ChatGTP and Next.js allows you to easily add a chatbot to your website or app. With the power of ChatGTP, you can create a wide range of chatbots for various use cases, such as customer support, e-commerce, and more.

Conclusion
This repository provides a simple example of how to integrate ChatGTP and Next.js. You can use this as a starting point for your own chatbot projects and customize it to fit your needs. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to the ChatGTP support team. Happy coding!
